# MealMatch app

## About the project
Our project aims to tackle one of the world's greatest mysteries. What's for dinner tonight? A question that has stumped us all at one point or another. However, with the use of Artificial Intelligence and the abundance of recipes online, we have an idea for a solution, MealMatch. A mobile web-app which allows you to input the ingredients you have in your pantry, receiving back a detailed recipe outlining a meal best suited to you and your kitchen. With the ability to save recipes, youâ€™ll be able to hold on to your favourite recipes and even plan out your recipes and groceries for the whole week. Print out a shopping list, share your favourite recipes, search for a related recipe, MealMatch will cover all your culinary needs in one space.

## How to get started
This app requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) to be installed. Follow the installation instructions on the website to install Node.js, then follow the steps below:
* Once Node.js is installed, navigate to the 'frontend' folder on the repository.
* Run the command `npm install`.

Now that next.js is installed correctly, we can run the application in 2 ways.
* To run the development server, run the command `npm run dev` 
* To run in production mode, run the command `npm build` followed by `npm start`
note: Development mode is recommended to be used during development as it is useful for debugging, while production mode is optimised for performance.

Finally, copy and paste the localhost server link from the terminal into your web browser (https://localhost:5000)
