# MealMatch app
Our project aims to tackle one of the world's greatest mysteries. What's for dinner tonight? A question that has stumped us all at one point or another. However, with the use of Artificial Intelligence and the abundance of recipes online, we have an idea for a solution, MealMatch. A mobile web-app which allows you to input the ingredients you have in your pantry, receiving back a detailed recipe outlining a meal best suited to you and your kitchen. With the ability to save recipes, youâ€™ll be able to hold on to your favourite recipes and even plan out your recipes and groceries for the whole week. Print out a shopping list, share your favourite recipes, search for a related recipe, MealMatch will cover all your culinary needs in one space.
